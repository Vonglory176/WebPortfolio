            <h5>Keith Rowley, My BATECH-289 Professor</h5>
            <hr/>
            <p>To whom it may concern,</p>
            <p>Skyler Conley was a student in my Spring 2023 BATECH 289 Front End Web Development class. He was an outstanding student, and has a unique perspective on both the coding process and the visual design process. I met one-on-one with him weekly, and was constantly amazed at his enthusiasm for coding and by the fluency of his web development. Our meetings were exciting, honest, forthright, fun, and unpredictable. I never knew what cool new code he would throw at his projects and assignments. He taught me a lot of new processes and pushed my ideas of what is possible.</p>
            <p>He was also a good listener, and was quite often inspired by my perspectives and feedback. I enjoyed the easy way we were able to toss ideas around, and loved seeing him work in front of my eyes in real time.</p>
            <p>I must also toss in the fact that he earned perfect scores on every single assignment. In short, Skyler is a model student and, I believe, a model front end developer. His communication skills, enthusiasm for learning, and friendly personality will allow him to serve quite well within any web development team.</p>
            <p>Feel free to contact me directly if you'd like to further discuss Skyler and his work.</p>
            <p>Sincerely,</p>
            <p>
