The work itself was of course very heavily focused on fundamental React concepts (like useState and useEffect) and Asynchronous Fetch calls in particular, though also involved extensive utilization of React-Bootstrap for much of the UI. </p>, <p>With the “Batch Size” feature being the latest addition to my program, I'm also planning on adding some basic Local Storage functions to allow easy reuse of previous prompts. I'd like a gallery feature of sorts as well, though this looks to require back-end work and is as such an idea on the shelf for now.</p>],
